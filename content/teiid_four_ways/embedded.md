[**Teiid 4 Ways**](..) &nbsp;&nbsp; < &nbsp;&nbsp; [Wildfly] (../teiid_wildfly) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; [Thorntail](../thorntail) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; [Microservices](../microservices) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; **Embedded**

**Teiid Embedded** is a light-weight version of Teiid for use in any Java 8+ JRE. WildFly nor any application server is not required. This feature is still evolving. Please consult the source examples and even unit tests utilizing the EmbeddedServer for a more complete guide as to its use.

See [**The Embedded Examples**](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-embedded-examples) for how to integrate multiple, heterogeneous data stores and enterprise services in a light-weight way.

Note that Teiid Embedded is intended for highly customized usage of Teiid or for use in unsupported platforms.  Please check out [**Teiid Spring Boot**](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-spring-boot) and [**Teiid Thorntail Examples**](https://github.com/teiid/thorntail-teiid-examples) for existing platform support.
