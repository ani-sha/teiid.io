**Teiid is all [about](/about) virtualizing your data to provide an [abstraction layer](/about/basics/vdbs) to facilitate ...**

 - performance optimization
 - improved security and governance
 - schema migration
 
## Bootable Runtimes
 
As a [Spring Boot](../teiid_runtimes/springboot) or [Thorntail](../teiid_runtimes/thorntail) developer you can define and deploy a VDB to your cloud environment quickly in a light-weight image.  Using a standard maven project you can run/test locally then build and even deploy your image.  Your VDB can just expose OData or REST to a single source, or combine and secure several sources - whatever your data virtualization and integration needs are.
