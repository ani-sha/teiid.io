##### Teiid Thorntail 2.1.0 is now available with support for Thorntail 2.4.

<!--more-->

The 2.1.0 release aligns with WildFly 15.0.1, Teiid 12.2.1, and Thorntail 2.4.0.Final.  This release supportsJava 11.  See the [examples](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-thorntail/tree/2.1.0/examples) to get started.

This will likely be the last Teiid Thorntail release.  Thorntail 4.x will merge with the [quarkus](http://quarkus.io/) efforts - that will be a large shift from the WildFly paradigm and so is not something that we will initially be able to follow.  With our Fuse alignment we will maintain [Teiid Spring Boot](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-spring-boot) in the interim until it's clear how we'll leverage quarkus.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
