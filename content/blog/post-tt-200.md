##### Teiid Thorntail 2.0.0 is now available with support for Thorntail 2.3.

<!--more-->

The 2.0.0 release aligns with WildFly 15.0.1, Teiid 12.1.0, and Thorntail 2.3.0.Final.  There will be another release once Thorntail adds support for Java 11.  See the [examples](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-thorntail/tree/master/examples) to get started.  

In general Teiid will follow the 2.x line of Thorntail, which is predominately based upon WildFly integration.  However Thorntail 4.x will merge with the [quarkus](quarkus.io) efforts - that will be a large shift from the WildFly paradigm and so is not something that we will initially be able to follow.  With our Fuse alignment we will maintain [Teiid Spring Boot](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-spring-boot) in the interim until it's clear how we'll leverage quarkus.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
