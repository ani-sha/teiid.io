#####  Teiid's community website has been redesigned and now available here, at [https://teiid.io](https://teiid.io)

Since we've been working on cloud focused data virtualization features, we decided to take the opportunity to move and streamlined our site content and build process to https://github.com/teiid/teiid.io.

<!--more-->

We've re-invented our Teiid community website to take advantage of github's content hosting feature. Majority of our new content will be in the form of markdown pages. Majority of the html from the old community site has been added as static pages so we have some broader continuity moving forward.

The new site generation process now includes a step utilizing a development staging build and publish step using Netlify.

## Check out the README.md on https://github.com/teiid/teiid.io for details
